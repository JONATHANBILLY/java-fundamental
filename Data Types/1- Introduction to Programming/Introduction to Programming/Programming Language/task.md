Natural languages are the languages that people speak, like English, They were not designed by people.     

Formal languages are languages designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.          

Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.

#### What is a programming language?     
***
It is a language we use to  communicate with computer.      
But computer understand only 0 and 1 represented in electric pulses.        
Therefore, computer runs only programs written in low-level language called machine language or assembly language.

Programmers use high-level languages like C++, Java, and Python which has a human-like syntax.

- Since the computer doesn't understand the human language those codes written in high-level language interpreted into a machine language using **compilers.**
