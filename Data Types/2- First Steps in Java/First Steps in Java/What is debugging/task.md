Programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called debugging.   

Three kinds of errors:

1. Syntax errors:    
System.out.println(Hello, world.);    
System.out.println("Hello, world.");

2. Run-time errors:    
Does not appear until you run the program, and it appears as windows or dialog boxes that contain information about what happened and what the program was doing when it happened.   

3. Logic errors and semantics:   
The program works but gives wrong output.  For example,   
if number<0
System.out.println("Number is positive");
