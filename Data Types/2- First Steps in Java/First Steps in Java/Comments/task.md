### The Line comment
If a line begins with //, the compiler will ignore the remainder of the	line.

This type of comment is used for the code writer or for a programmer who  modifies the code and make it easier for other readers, for example:    

`// This is a comment`
### The Block comment
If lines begins with /* and ends with*/ we call it a block comment for example:    
`/* The compiler ignores anything in between the two stars this type of  comment can span several lines */`
