Java programs work by having things called objects perform actions.     
`System.out` **: an object used for sending output to the screen.**      
**The actions** performed by an object are called **methods.**      
`println` **: the method or action that the `System.out` object performs.**

**Method invocation syntax (in order):** _an object, a dot (period), the method name, and a pair of parentheses._           
**Arguments: Zero or more pieces of information needed by the method that are placed inside the parentheses.**      
`System.out.println("This is an argument");`


| Statement              | Effect                                                                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `System.out.print()`   | Prints a message in the console.                                                          |
| `System.out.println()` | is called newline, Prints a message and moves the cursor to the next line of the display. |

After every statement, you must place a semicolon \; at the end of the line.

You can use the shortcut *sout* to type quickly the println statement.

**There are many ways of running a Java code:**
- You can click on the green triangle at the left of the class or the *main* method.
- You can right-click on the .java file and click on **Run**.
- You can click on the *Run* tab on the toolbar, and select **Run**.
- You can use the shortcut &shortcut:Run;.
- In this course, you can click on **Run button** below.
