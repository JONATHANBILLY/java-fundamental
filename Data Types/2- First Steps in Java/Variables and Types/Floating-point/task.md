**Floating point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points.** 

For example, the numbers 5.5, 0.001, and -2,345.6789 are floating point numbers.    
Numbers that do not have decimal places are called integers.    
int x=5; 

**In Java, the floating-point type is called double.  
double pi = 3.14;**
