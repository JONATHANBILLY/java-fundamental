In calculator, we use mathematical functions like sin and log.  
sin(3.14)*                                 
log(1/x)

#### In Java, these functions are called methods which are invoked using a syntax.   
double root = Math.sqrt(17.0);  
double height = Math.sin(1.5);

##### Note: Expression in parentheses is called the argument

#### Useful Methods

Java provides Math.PI:  
    double degrees = 90;  
    double angle = degrees * 2 * Math.PI / 360.0;
 
Another useful method in the Math class is round which rounds a point value off to the nearest integer and returns an int.    
    int x = Math.round(Math.PI * 20.0);
