We do assignment with an assignment statement to store value for the variable.  
Example:    
`FirstName="Mohammed"; `  
`Age=30;`       

**Storing a value Syntax:**     
`<variable name> = <variable value>;`

You can initialize and declare a variable at the same time:

`<data type> <variable name> = <variable value>;`

To sum up, the concept beyond this process  is:     
**When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.       
When you make an assignment to a variable, you give it a value.**    

#### Composition
It is the ability to combine variables, expressions, and statements.    
Example:    
`int percentage, minute=30; ` <br>
`percentage = (minute * 100) / 60;  ` <br>
