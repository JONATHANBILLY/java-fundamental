***
A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value.

#### Form: TYPE NAME;

#### Example: String FirstName;  
This statement is a declaration, because it declares that the variable named **FirstName** has the type **String**.

Can we declare multiple variables with the same type?   
**String FirstName, LastName;**

You should take care to get it right. There is no such type as Int or string, 
and the compiler will object if you mistype the syntax int , String
