#### What if we want to check whether a number is Even or Odd.
We know that integers are either Even or Odd only. There in nothing in between.
**This means checking for the first condition if true, if not, perform an alternative execution which is the second.**

### Relational operators
The condition can contain any of the comparison operators, sometimes called **relational operators:**       


| Relational <br/>Operators | Example  | Meaning                         |
|---------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `==`                      | *x == y* | x equals y                      |
| `!=`                      | *x != y* | x is not equal to y             |
| `>`                       | *x > y*  | x is greater than y             |
| `<`                       | *x < y*  | x is less than y                |
| `>=`                      | *x >= y* | x is greater than or equal to y |
| `<=`                      | *x <= y* | x is less than or equal to y    |

* #### **The outcome of these operations is a boolean value.**
