#### The modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder.
In Java, the modulus operator is a percent sign, %.         
For example:        
`int quotient = 7 / 3;     `  
`int remainder = 7 % 3;  `    
The first operator, integer division, yields 2. The second operator yields 1.       
Thus, 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

**The power of Modulus:**       
You can check if the number is Even.     
Also, you can check whether one number is divisible by another:       
if x % y is zero, then
x is divisible by y.
