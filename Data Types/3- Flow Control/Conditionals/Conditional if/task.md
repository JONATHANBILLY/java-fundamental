Often, we need to check conditions in programs.
* Positive or Negative.
* Even or Odd.
* Pass or Fail.

In Java, we use conditional statements to do so.

**The _if_ Statement Syntax:**      
`if (Boolean_Expression) {`       
`Action_Statement }`      

The `Boolean_Expression` is called **the condition.**     

**If `Boolean_Expression` is true, then `Action_Statement` is executed**; otherwise, nothing happens and the program goes on to the next statement.

#### Note: When there's **only one** statement inside a conditional, you can omit the braces {}.
