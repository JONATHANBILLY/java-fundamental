Sometimes it is necessary or convenient to end a loop prematurely or skip an iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration.
It can be accomplished by placing the keywords *`break`* or *`continue`*, respectively.

#### The `break` Statement
* If we want to go out of a loop then we use a break statement.
* If we use a break statement in a loop then execution will continue with the immediate next statement outside the loop.
* After a break, all the remaining statements in the loop are skipped (terminated). The break statement can be used in a while loop, for loop, and do-while loop.

#### The `continue` Statement
* continue does not terminate the loop, it just skips some part of the loop.
* When we do not want to execute some statements then we use a continue statement to skip those statements from execution.
* If the continue statement is confronted in the program then it will start the next iteration.
