In while statement, the Boolean expression is checked **before** the loop body is executed.


The syntax of *while* loops is

`while ( <condition> ) `
`{`
`code to execute`
`}`


#### Note: If you execute a code and encountered an Infinite\endless loop, you can terminate the execution of the code with &shortcut:Stop; or by clicking the red square on the top right.
