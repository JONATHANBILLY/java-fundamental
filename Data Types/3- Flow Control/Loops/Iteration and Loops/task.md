Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. This process is called **loop**.       
The code that is repeated in a loop is called the **body of the loop**.     
Each repetition of the loop body is called an **iteration of the loop.**

**An if statement will execute once if a condition is true but loop will run as many times as it needs to while a condition is true.**


**The three Java loop statements are:**
1. [ ]  **for** statement.
2. [ ]  **while** statement.
3. [ ]  **do-while** statement.
