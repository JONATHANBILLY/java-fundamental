Loops can be nested, just like other Java structures.
**Nested loop is a loop inside another loop.**
* When nested, the inner loop iterates from beginning to end for each single iteration of the outer loop.

**The Nested Loops syntax:**

`for (int i=0; i<10; i++)   {`		
`statements `    		
`for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {		`		
`	  statements		`		
`}	}	`


The adjacent showcases a Nested Loops that prints week number and for each week, it prints days number.
