For loop is so common in programming.

The for Loop Syntax:    
` for (INITIALIZER; CONDITION; INCREMENTOR)
{
BODY
}`

It starts by initializing a variable; a condition, that depends on that variable; and inside the loop they do something to that variable, like increment it.

#### Incrementing and decrementing
Incrementing and decrementing are such common operations that Java provides special operators for them.

**The ++ operator adds one to the current value of an int or char.    
-- subtracts one.**

Neither operator works on doubles, booleans or Strings.

So both below expressions are same:   
number = number + 1    OR   number++



What does the += operator do in Java?

x = x + y is equivalent to  x+=y.   
x = x + 1 is equivalent to  x+=1.   
x = x + 2 is equivalent to  x+=2.   
x = x - y is equivalent to  x-=y.   
x = x * y is equivalent to  x*=y.   
and so on
