Java doesn't perform this operation automatically.  

#### The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer is to use a **typecast**.
### Typecasting
**Typecasting is so called because it allows you to take a value that belongs to one type and "cast" it into another type.**

The syntax:   
double pi = 3.14;   
int x = (int) pi; // So, x gets the value 3

int x = 3;  
double x = (double) x; // So, x gets the value 3.0
