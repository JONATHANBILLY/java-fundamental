When one or both operands are a floating-point type, division results in a floating-point type.     
15.0/2 evaluates to 7.5     

When both operands are integer types, division results in an integer type.      
**Any fractional part is discarded.**       
15/2 evaluates to 7     

**Be careful to make at least one of the operands a floating-point type if the fractional portion is needed.**
