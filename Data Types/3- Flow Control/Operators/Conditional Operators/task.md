Conditional operators use to evaluate a condition that's applied to one or two boolean expressions. **The result of the evaluation is either true or false.**

**The Conditional operators** are also called **Comparison Operators** and **Relational Operators**.

| Operators                     | Notation in Java |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Equal to                      | `==`          |
| Different than / not equal to | `!=`          |
| Less than                     | `< `           |
| Less than or equal to         | `<= `          |
| Greater than                  | `> `           |
| Greater than or equal to      | `>=`           |

Notice the first two statements can also be applied to **boolean values** as well as **numerical values**.
