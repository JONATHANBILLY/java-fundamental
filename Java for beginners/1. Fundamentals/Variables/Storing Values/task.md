It is possible to save information inside a Java program.
To do so, you must first tell Java which type of data it contains.
The most used data types are
- *int* to store integers, that is, numbers without decimal digits.
- *double* to store numbers with decimal digits.
- *boolean* to store true/false values.
- *String* to save literal messages.

The syntax to declare a variable is

`<data type> <variable name>;`

After being declared, to set the variable's value, type

`<variable name> = <variable value>;`

You can initialize and declare a variable at the same time:

`<data type> <variable name> = <variable value>;`

This code contains examples of this.

##### Note: Unlike math, the order is important in coding. Line 5 cannot be *int 24 = hoursInADay;*. The values at both sides of the *=* sign are not interchangeable.
