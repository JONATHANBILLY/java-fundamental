You may update the value of a variable whenever you want to.
Set the new value using the assignment operator *=*.

**Do not declare the same value again.**
Java will think that you are trying to create two different variables
with the same name, which is not allowed.

Use the usual math rules of mathematical operations and operators precedence.
The following table summarizes the basic arithmetic operators in descending order of precedence.

| Operation      | Operator |
|----------------|----------|
| Grouping       | `( ) `     |
| Multiplication |` +`        |
| Division       | `/ `       |
| Addition       | `+  `      |
| Subtraction    | `- `       |

##### Note: The escaping character \\n inside the print statement tells Java to introduce a new line. Like pressing &shortcut:EditorStartNewLine;.
