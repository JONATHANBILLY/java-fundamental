***
Be careful whenever using the division operator (\/): the division of two integers will result
in another integer. Java will ignore the decimal digits after doing the calculation.

There are two ways of dealing with this limitation:
1. Declare the numerical variable involved as an *int* type.
2. Cast one of the integers to a double type, as shown here.

##### Note: Notice that it is possible to declare and initialize more than one variable in one line, as long as they're the same type (see line 5).
