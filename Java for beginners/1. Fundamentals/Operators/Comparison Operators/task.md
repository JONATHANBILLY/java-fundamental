If you compare two numbers you'll also arrive at a *true* or *false* equivalent result.
The comparison operators are equivalent also to those used in mathematics:

| Operators                     | Notation in Java |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Equal to                      | `==`          |
| Different than / not equal to | `!=`          |
| Less than                     | `< `           |
| Less than or equal to         | `<= `          |
| Greater than                  | `> `           |
| Greater than or equal to      | `>=`           |

Notice the first two statements can also be applied to boolean values as well as numerical values.

This code shows how these comparison operators can be used.
