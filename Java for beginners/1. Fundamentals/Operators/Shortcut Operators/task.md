The last type of numerical operators we're covering are in essence shorter notations for the arithmetic operators we already used.

If you want to add 3 to x, instead of typing

`x = x + 3;`

you may write

`x += 3;`

A very common occurrence in coding is adding 1 to an integer.
If you want to add 1 to y, instead of typing

`y = y + 1;`

you may code

`y++;`

And a similar notation applies to subtracting 1 to a variable.

The following table summarizes this

| Long notation | Short notation |
|---------------|----------------|
| `a = a + 1;`    | `a++; `          |
| `b = b - 1;`    | `b--; `          |
| `c = c + 2;`    | `c += 2; `       |
| `d = d - 3;`    | `d -= 3;  `      |
| `e = e * 4; `   | `e *= 4;  `      |
| `f = f / 5;  `  | `f /= 5; `       |
| `g = g % 6; `   | `g %= 6;    `    |

The last operator is called the *modulo* operator, and it gives you the remainder after performing the division.
