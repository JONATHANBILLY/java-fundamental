Inside the main method you can place two types of print statements.

| Command              | Effect                                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `System.out.print()`   | Prints a message in the console.                     |
| `System.out.println()` | Prints a message in the console, then ends the line. |
|                      |                                                      |
After every command, like those, you must
place a semicolon \; at the end of the line.

You can use the shortcut *sout* to type quickly the println command.

To duplicate a line, you can use the shortcut &shortcut:EditorDuplicate;.

There are many ways of running a Java code:
- You can click on the green triangle at the left of the class or the *main* method.
- You can right-click on the .java file and click on **Run**.
- You can click on the *Run* tab on the toolbar, and select **Run**.
- You can use the shortcut &shortcut:Run;.

##### Note: The compiler will not insert spaces between messages unless you tell it to.
