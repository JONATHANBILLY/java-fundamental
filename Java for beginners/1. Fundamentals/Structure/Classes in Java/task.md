Introduction to Java
=========================================================
___
***
#### This course aims to provide an overview of the programming language. It contains the main structures explained, along with examples and exercises to test comprehension.

##### Originally made for the Grade 9 students of Hsinchu International School, in Taiwan.

Every Java file ends in .java, and it should
contain a class inside with the same name.

If you want your Java file to do something, then
you should place a *main* method inside that class.

The braces \{ \} indicate the scope of the structure
involved, like a class or the *main* method.

Place the lines you want your code to execute
inside the main method.

The file you are seeing shows you the appropriate
syntax of a simple Java program.
---
##### Note: The IDE (IntelliJ) takes care of compiling the .java file into a .class file that the JVM can understand and execute.
