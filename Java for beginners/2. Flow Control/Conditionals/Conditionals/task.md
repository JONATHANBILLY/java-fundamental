You can select in which way a program develops depending on the value of some variable or an input.
This is called branching or applying conditions.

In Java, branching is done through the keyword *if*. After an *if* there must be
a parentheses enclosing a condition that simplifies into a single boolean value.

When the code reaches a condtional statement, **if** the condition is equivalent to
*true*, the block of code enclosed by braces after it will be executed.

The code displayed here exemplifies this concept. Run it and examine how it operates.

#### Note: The *if* declaration is not a statement, so you must not place semicolons at their end.
