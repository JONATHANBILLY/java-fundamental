The other basic structure of every programming language are loops.

In essence, whenever your program reaches one of these declarations, it will execute the code inside it multiple times.

The *for* loop follows the following syntax:

**for ( *\<looping variable initialization>*; \<condition to repeat the loop>; \<looping variable update> )
{
code to repeat
}**

The *for* loop will start by initializing the looping variable, then it will execute the code once,
then it updates the value of the variable and proceeds to check the condition; if the
condition holds true, then it repeats the block of code again, then proceeds to update
the variable and check the condition again and so on.
The loop will stop once the condition results equivalent to *false*.
