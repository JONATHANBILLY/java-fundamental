Java is capable of running two types of loops.

Apart from *for* loops that run a predetermined number of times, there exist *while* loops
that run as long as some condition is met.

The syntax of *while* loops is

`while ( <condition> ) `
`{`
  `code to execute`
`}`

The apparent simplicity of this loop is counterbalanced by the fact that some variable must be updated
inside the loop that eventually turns the condition into a falsity, thus ending the loop and avoiding an infinite cycle.

On the left you can see a couple of simple examples.

#### Note: If you're stuck on an endless loop, you can terminate the execution of the code with &shortcut:Stop; or by clicking the red square on the top right.
