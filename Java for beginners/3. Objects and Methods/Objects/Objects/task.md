Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language.

What that means is that every class in Java is supposed to be a blueprint of an object with the same name.

The syntax to declare a new object is:

`<object_type> <object_name>;`

To initialize an object, you have to create it using the word *new*:

`<object_name> = new <class_name>();`

You can declare and initialize at the same type like this:

`<object_type> <object_name> = new <class_name>();`

This is analogous to declaration and initialization of primitive data types
seen in Unit 1 (`int`, `double`, `boolean`). The structure and syntax is identical.

Hopefully the example provided can be enlightening.

#### Note: An object in Java is also called an *instance*, and the process of creating an object is called *instantiation*.
