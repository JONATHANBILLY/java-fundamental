Objects can store values and execute instructions.
The former are attributes and the latter are methods.

The idea of objects is that they each have a different value of a common characteristic.

For example, every Car has a color and a brand, but their values are different for each car.

To declare an instance attribute, create a variable **outside** the main method.
Java will recognize the syntax and every object you create will have a copy of that variable that can store a different value in each object.

To access the value of an attribute, refer to the object's name, then type a dot and the attribute's name.
You may modify this value just as you do with a usual variable, but remember that you will be
changing the value of that attribute for the object you are referring to.

The code attached aims to illustrate the concept just mentioned.

#### Note: The word *private* means that the attribute can only be accessed by this class.
