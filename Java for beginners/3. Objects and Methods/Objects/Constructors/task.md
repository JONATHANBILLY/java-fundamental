Notice how repetitive the process of creating an object and assigning values
for its variables is. There's a structure that fixes this: constructors.

Constructors tell Java how to make an object when you already know which are the values you
want to assign to their attributes.

The syntax is

`public <class_name> ( <parameters> )
{ values assignation }`

Never place them inside the main method.

Study the code to the left.

#### Note: The keyword *public* allows any class to access it, be it a class or an attribute.
