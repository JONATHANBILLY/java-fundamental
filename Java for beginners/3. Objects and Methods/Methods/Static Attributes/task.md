There are some attributes that are shared among all objects of a certain type.

For example, every airplane has a different size or color, but they all have two wings.

In cases like that, another type of attribute should be used to store such shared values.
They're called *static* attributes.

To make an attribute *static*, place that keyword after the access modifier (*public*).

Of course, you may want to use methods that change static attributes. In such cases the methods
themselves are also called *static* methods and the keyword *static* should also be placed
after the access modifier (public).

As always, the code may be helpful in understanding this topic.
