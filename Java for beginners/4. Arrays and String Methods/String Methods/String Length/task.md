*String* is not a primitive type like *int* or *boolean*, it is
an object that contains an array
of *char* values. That means somewhere inside the
String class, the original Java developers declared also
instance methods for String objects.

In other words, you can apply special methods to Strings. These are two examples:

- `.repeat()`: `"Java".repeat(3)` will give you *"JavaJavaJava"*.
- `.length()`: `"Java".length()` will return *4*.

Their names are self-explanatory, but in any case, there are some examples here.
